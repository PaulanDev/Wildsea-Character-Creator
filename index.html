      This is a non-official website to allow people to make characters for the
      TTRPG The Wildsea by Felix Isaacs. This is just a little project that I've
      wanted to make for a long time to practice some basic web dev.

        Your bloodline describes what you are, a truth written in blood or sap
        or chitin. You'll be instantly recognizable as a member of your
        bloodline, unless you go to impressive length to hide it.

      <p id="origin-blurb">
        Your origin denotes the kind of environment you lived in before you
        became a wildsailor. It doesn't need to be where you grew up, though it
        can be - it could be a place or culture that left a lasting impact on
        you.
